# pyaint
## What is it?
pyaint is a simple bot written in Python that can automatically draw images by taking control of your mouse. It works on MS Paint, Clip Studio Paint, skribbl (with the risk of being kicked) or essentially any image editing software as long as there is support for a brush, a color palette grid and a canvas.
